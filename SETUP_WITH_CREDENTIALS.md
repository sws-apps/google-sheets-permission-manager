## Important Notes

### Credentials Already Included
- The `.env` file in `/backend` contains Google Cloud OAuth credentials

- These files are in `.gitignore` and stored locally only

### Service Account Email
The service account email that has access to sheets:
```
sheets-manager@sheet-automation-ppp-naics.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

**IMPORTANT:** Any Google Sheets you want to process must be shared with this email address!

### Security
- NEVER commit credentials to any public repository
- Keep this repository private
- Only share access with trusted collaborators

### Adding Collaborators
To give someone access to this repository:
1. Go to Settings â†’ Manage access

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:
