# Complete Field Extraction Summary

## ✅ All Issues Fixed!

### 1. **Address Fields - FIXED**
The address extraction was incorrect due to wrong cell mappings. Now correctly extracting:
- **Street**: 507 Watercrest Circle (B28) ✅
- **City**: elizabeth city (B29 - was incorrectly mapped to C28) ✅  
- **State**: NC (C29 - was incorrectly mapped to D28) ✅
- **ZIP**: 27909 (D29 - was incorrectly mapped to B29) ✅

### 2. **Additional Fields Analysis**
After thorough analysis of the Excel file:

#### Fields Successfully Added:
- **Q4 2021 Employee Count**: Added mapping for K11, but cell is empty in this template
- **Employee Retention Credit Labels**: Added from 941 form (rows 13-15)

#### Fields Found but Without Values:
- **NAICS Code**: Label exists at D58 but no actual value in adjacent cells
- **PPP Loan Date**: Label exists at D56 but no actual value in adjacent cells

These appear to be template placeholders that would be filled in by users.

### 3. **Total Field Extraction**
- **Total fields extracted**: 95 fields
- **All critical business data**: Successfully extracted
- **Multi-sheet support**: Working correctly across all 3 data sheets

## Current Extraction Capabilities

### From "Data Dump" Sheet:
✅ Company EIN  
✅ Company Legal Name  
✅ Trade Name  
✅ Full Address (Street, City, State, ZIP)

### From "Understandable Data-final" Sheet:

✅ Shutdown standards (11 criteria)  
✅ Gross receipts for 2019, 2020, 2021 (quarterly)  
✅ Employee counts by year  
✅ PPP forgiveness amounts  
✅ Ownership structure

### From "941 form" Sheet:
✅ Quarterly employee counts (2020-2021)  
✅ Quarterly taxable wages

## Testing Results

```
✅ Address correctly extracted with State: NC, ZIP: 27909
✅ All company information fields extracted
✅ PPP forgiveness amounts extracted: PPP1=$79,515, PPP2=$130,038
Total fields extracted: 95
```

## Notes for Future Enhancement

1. **Template vs Filled Data**: Some fields (NAICS code, PPP loan date) exist as labels but may not have values in every template. The system correctly identifies these.

2. **Q4 2021 Data**: The template includes mapping for Q4 2021 but the sample file doesn't contain this data.

3. **Flexible Parser**: The system includes a flexible parser for non-standard templates, ensuring robust data extraction even with variations.

## Usage

The system now correctly:
1. Extracts ALL address components including state and ZIP
2. Reads data from multiple sheets in the Excel file
3. Exports all data to a single-tab Excel file for easy viewing
4. Handles both template labels and actual data values appropriately
